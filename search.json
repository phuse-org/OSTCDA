Please contribute your thoughts, perspectives, references, citations, and links through that mechanism. We’d like to be able to attribute your ideas to you, so providing the rationale supporting your thoughts will strengthen your argument. Please be as thoughtful and thorough in your contributions as you can! You can also upvote questions and/or responses that you find particularly valuable.\nAt the moment, this document is in draft form, hence please DO NOT CITE it as a reference.\nTo learn more about this initiative, please watch our [2023 R in Pharma](https://rinpharma.com/){target=“_blank”} lightning talk The State of Open Source Technology in Clinical Data Analysis, Reporting, and Submissions.\nThank you to PHUSE for supporting this endeavor. And thank you to YOU for your thoughtful contributions to the effort."
