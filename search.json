We want to create a comprehesive knowledge base about the “state of the union” and provide an overview and ideally also answers for core questions. We need and collect input from our community to compile the knowledge base, so please join the discussions to allow a broad and complete picutre.\nIf you like to know more, please join the R/Pharma talk “The State of Open Source Technology in Clinical Data Analysis, Reporting, and Submissions”. The recording is here: 2023 R/Pharma presentation."
